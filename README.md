README

This repo simulates entangelement generation between two nodes
using time-bin photons. It is modeled heavily off of 'example1' from Chapter 3
of SeQUeNCe's tutorial found here:

/SeQUeNCe/docs/source/tutorial/chapter3/example1.py

which is done using photons wiht the encoding type of single_atom. This
encoding type essentially means the basis of the quantum state of the photons is
{|0>, |1>}, denoting photon existing or not. Time-bin photons have quantum
states expressed by the basis {|E>, |L>} denoting early and late arriving
photons respectively.



PURELY TO CHECK IF THIS WORKS
